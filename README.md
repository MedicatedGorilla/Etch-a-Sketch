# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a small Etch-A-Sketch project meant to demonstrate my js knowledge so far. It utilizes the fundamentals of js to create an interactive grid of DIVs using flexbox only and not grid. You can optionally change the size of the board as well. To get the intial 16x16 board, just press start.
